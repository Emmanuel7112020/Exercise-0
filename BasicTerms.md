1.The algorithm is the entire sequence of actions starting from taking two sweets randomly from the glass to either putting blue sweet back into the glass or eating both
sweets and replacing them with a pick from the lucky bag.
2.No, it does not terminate. This is the outcome regardless of the scenario.
Scenario 1: Picking two red sweets or blue sweets would imply that both chosen sweets should be eaten and then a red sweet is taken from the lucky bag into the glass. If it 
is assumed that the trend continues, the glass will eventually be occupied by red sweets. This in turn would mean any randomly chosen sweet would be of the same colour that 
would be eaten and replaced with a red sweet from a bag which has an infinite amount of red sweets.
Scenario 2: Assuming the randomly selected sweets were always of different colours, the red sweet would be eaten and the blue sweet would be would be placed back in the glass. 
If the selection trend continues, the glass would eventually have only blue sweets in it and subsequent random draw of sweets would mean that sweets of same colour would be 
chosen. This will mean that a red sweet would always have to be moved from the lucky bag to the glass. This would mean an endless replacement of sweets in the glass from a
luck bag which contains an infinite amount of red sweets.
3.The number of sweets left in the glass cannot be determined.
4.The result is not deterministic.
